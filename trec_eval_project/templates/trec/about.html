<div class="large-title"> About </div>

<div class="medium-text">What is TREC? </div>
<p>TREC's aim is to increase and support the research community focused on large-scale information evaluation and retrieval by providing a community of users an easy means of comparing their results under a common set of evaluation methods. </p>

<div class="medium-text">What do these P10, P20 and MAP numbers mean?</br> 
I thought this was about search results not geography why do we need maps?</div>
<p>
	P10 = The relevancy of the first 10 results displayed by the search engine.<br>
	P20 = The relevancy of the first 20 results displayed by the search engine.<br>
	MAP =  MAP stands for Mean Average Precision which is the overall average.
</p>

<div class="medium-text">Let's say I wanted to become a "TREC-Y" and participate. How would I go about this?</div>
<p>
	Its easy just register and sign in to the website to become a new "trec-y" then navigate to the track and task you'd like to enter and click the "Upload a run" link.
</p>

<div class="medium-text">Right so after signing up when do we get to meet Spock?</div>
<p>
	Sorry that's a different type of "trecy" not associated with our organisation. 
	Your probably interested in an upcoming company called Starfleet or the United Federation of Planets.
	Also we have some bad news for you about Leonard Nimoy.
</p>

<div class="medium-text">Oh... so what does a track consist of?</div>
<p>
	Think of a track like a category of problem. There are a lot of different types of problem out there in the world. 
	What's important enough about these problems for us to tell you are the title, genre and general description of the problem.
	Within each track you'll discover a whole bunch of fun tasks to compete against other researchers and solve.
	How many leaderboards will you rise to the top of?
</p>

<div class="medium-text">Ahh man I accidentally set my profile picture to be that one of me and my old girlfriend. My current one is going to be pissed!</br> How do I change my profile's information?</div>
<p>
	A profile's information can be edited by the 'Edit' button inside of your profile page.
</p>

<div class="medium-text">Tables are lame and boring. Where are the graphs?</div>
<p>
	You're in luck as we many different types of graph on offer including average MAP scores per track and detailed performance graphs for individual runs.
