Probably all terrible and useless but played around with Python and running the trec_eval. 

This assumes the thing has been compiled and the python files are being run from within the trec_eval.9.0 folder directly. 

Will fix that later but just wanted to get general feel of what to do / how to run the runs / etc. 

Again probably waste of time but you never know.
